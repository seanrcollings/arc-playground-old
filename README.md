## IDEAS:
- Use of new autocompletion for suggesting commands
- Some more plugins to codemirror to make editing smoother
- Allow people to save a snippet and share it (base64 encoded string? (or could just store it in a db))
- Use sessions to save what people have edited so it can persist over reloads
- Have the settings page be generated based off of a query to the backend (and the arc_config object)
- Improve scolling to output (or just remove it?)
- Option to clear output
-
